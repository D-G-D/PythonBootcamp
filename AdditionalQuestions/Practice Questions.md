# Practice Questions

## Introduction

This file contains additional questions to practice the Python syntax. You have seen the necessary syntax if you have learnt up to the technical note in the heading (included).

## Questions [PY3]

1. Write a Python function which, a date in string format 'YYYY-MM-DD' (Example: February 8th, 2024 is 2024-02-08) checks that the month part of the string is correct. An example of an incorrect month would be 2024-13-08, as there is no month 13.

2. Write a Python function that checks if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. Write a Python function that checks if a point in the 2-D plane (parameters `x` and `y`) is within a square of side length `sq_len` and outside of a circle of radius `r`. Both the square and the circle are centered in the origin.

4. Write a Python function that returns the cost of buying `n` tickets for a spectacle, if the seller is giving away one for free for every 4 paid tickets ($10.00 each).
