# Assignment

This assignment is based on the project **Barcelona restaurants in TripAdvisor**. You can replace it by **Madrid restaurants in TripAdvisor**, if preferred. In this project you will analyze the TripAdvisor data set from three different points of view, each time using Python.

### Submission

1. Submit, through Blackboard, a readable and printable report explaining what you have done, including Python input and output. This can be a Word document, a PDF document or a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb).

2. Put your name on top of the document.

3. It is acceptable to use ChatGPT to help you when writing Python code, but you must provide your prompts in your report as well. Make sure to try yourself first and don't only rely on ChatGPT. Purely solving the exercises using ChatGPT will result in a C.

### Deadline

January 3 (Wednesday), 24:00.
