# [PY-02] Starting with Python 

## Typing Python code

In this tutorial of typing Python code, we assume that you are using Jupyter Qt Console. Almost everything would also be valid in other interfaces to a Python interpreter, with minor adjustments. Before starting, a reminder: Python is **case sensitive**. 

The console produces input prompts (such as `In[1]:`), where you can type a command and press `Return`. Then Python returns either an output (preceded by `Out[1]:`), a (typically long and difficult) error message, or no answer at all. A simple example follows.

```
In [1]: 2 + 2
Out[1]: 4
```

So, if you enter `2 + 2`, the output will be the result of this calculation. But, if you want to store this result for later use (in the same session), you will enter it with a name, as follows:

```
In [2]: a = 2 + 2
```

This creates the **variable** `a`. Note that the value of `2 + 2` is not outputted now. But you can call it:

```
In [3]: a
Out[3]: 4
```

In Pyhton, when you assign a value to a variable which has already been created, the previous assignment is forgotten. So:

```
In [4]: a = 7 - 2

In [5]: a
Out[5]: 5
```

If you copypaste in the console code chunks from a text editor (which is what you would do if you were working in the console, so you could readily save your code), you can input several code lines at once. In that case, you will only get the output for the last line. If the cursor is not at the end of the last line, you have to press *Shift+Return* to get the output. An example follows.

```
In [6]: b = 2 * 3
   ...: b - 1
   ...: b**2
Out[6]: 36
```

*Note*. You would probably have written `b^2` for the square of 2, but the caret symbol (`^`) plays a different role in Python.

## Python packages

Since the basic Python toolkit (without any package) is quite limited, you will need additional resources for practically everything. These resources come in **packages**. For instance, suppose that you want to do some math, and calculate the square root of 2. You will then **import** the package `math`, whose resources include the square root and many other mathematical functions. Once the package has been imported, all its functions are available. You can then apply the function `math.sqrt`. This notation indicates that `sqrt` is a function of the module `math`.

In the console, the square root calculation shows up as:

```
In [7]: import math
   ...: math.sqrt(2)
Out[7]: 1.4142135623730951
```

Alternatively, you can import only the functions that you plan to use:

```
In [8]: from math import sqrt
   ...: sqrt(2)
Out[8]: 1.4142135623730951
```

Packages are imported just for the current kernel. You can only import a package only if it is already **installed** in your computer. Some packages, such as NumPy and Pandas, will appear layer in the following lectures.

## Numeric data types

As in other languages, data can have different **data types** in Python. The data type can be learned with the function `type`. Let us start with the numeric types. First, the **integers** have type `int`:

```
In [9]: type(2)
Out[9]: int
```

Another numeric type is that of **floating-point** numbers (`float`):

```
In [10]: type(2.4)
Out[10]: float
```

Note that, in Python, integers are not, as in the mathematics textbook, a subset of the real numbers, but a different type. We also have **Boolean** (`bool`) data, which are either `True` or `False`:

```
In [11]: type(True)
Out[11]: bool
```

Mind that it is `True` and `False` in Python, not `TRUE` and `FALSE` (as in R), nor `true` and `false` (as in Java). As you may know, some applications have Booleans (like Excel), but others don't (like MySQL). When there are no Booleans, they are replaced by 1 and 0. In Python, `True` and `False` are the same as 1 and 0 for many purposes, as we will see below.

## Strings

Besides numbers, we can also manage **strings** with type `str`:

```
In [12]: type('Miguel')
Out[12]: str
```

Strings are always enclosed by quote marks, either single or double (but same way on both sides). In Python, a string is a sequence of **characters**. This includes the (English) alphanumeric characters and also special characters like white space, punctuation, etc. Other symbols, like emoticons, can also appear in your data, specially in social networks data. Besides that, you can also manage letters from other languages (Spanish, Portuguese, etc) or alphabets (Cyrillic, hiragana, etc), and even ideographs (such as Han characters).

There is a basic set of 128 characters, called the **ASCII characters**, which are encoded as numbers (from 0 to 127) in the same way by all the computers, so you will never have trouble with them. They include the English letters (without accents), the numbers, basic punctuation (not curly quote marks or long dashes), white space, **control characters** such as the new line, represented in many computer languages (including Python) as `\n`, and other symbols familiar to you, such as the dollar (`$`) and the hash (`#`) symbols. The complete list can be easily found in Internet.

Non-ASCII characters can be encoded by different computers or different text editors in different ways. Mind that, if you capture string data on your own, you will probably find some of these characters in your data. Even when the documents are expected to be in English, they can be contaminated by other languages: Han characters, German dieresis, Spanish eñe, etc.

The preferred **encoding** is **UTF-8**, used by Python. UTF-8 is the default encoding in Macintosh computers, but not in Windows computers, which use their own system, which is region specific. In US and Western Europe, this is **Windows-1252**.

The UTF-8 encoding can be easily learned from the Python interpreter. For instance, for the lowercase 'a':

```
In [13]: ord('a')
Out[13]: 97
```
The uppercase 'A' is 

```
In [14]: ord('A')
Out[14]: 65
```

The Spanish 'ñ':

```
In [15]: ord('ñ')
Out[15]: 241
```

This goes beyond 127, so it is not an ASCII character, and it may show up in different computers. Strings can be concatenated in a straightforward way:

In [16]: 'Donald' + ' ' + 'Trump'
Out[16]: 'Donald Trump'

## Type conversions

The functions `int` and `float` can be used to convert numbers from one type to another type (sometimes at a loss):

```
In [17]: float(2)
Out[17]: 2.0
```

```
In [18]: int(2.3)
Out[18]: 2
```

Sometimes, you can convert numbers to strings and conversely:

```
In [19]: int('27')
Out[19]: 27
```

```
In [20]: float('27')
Out[20]: 27.0
```

```
In [21]: str(27)
Out[21]: '27'
```

Boolean variables can be converted to `int` and `float` type with the functions mentioned above, but also by means of a mathematical operator:

```
In [22]: 1 + True
Out[22]: 2
```

```
In [23]: math.sqrt(False)
Out[23]: 0.0
```

## Comparison operators

Let us how the **comparison operators** work in Python. For sure, you know the *lower than* symbol:

```
In [24]: 5 < a
Out[24]: False
```

When you input an expression involving a comparison operator, Python evaluates it, returning either `True` or `False`. The following example uses the **equality operator**, which is denoted in Python by a double equal sign:

```
In [25]: a == 4
Out[25]: True
```

Why two equal signs? The reason is that a single equal sign is used to assign names. So `a = 4` is interpreted, not as asking whether `a` is equal to `4`, but as creating a variable named `a` whose value is `4`. The *not equal* operator is denoted by an equal sign preceded by an admiration symbol (`!`):

```
In [26]: a != 4
Out[26]: False
```

Other examples involving comparison operators:

```
In [27]: 'a' > 'b'
Out[27]: False
```

```
In [28]: 'A' <= 'a'
Out[28]: True
```

Numbers and booleans can be compared irrespective of their types:

```
In [29]: 3 == 3.0
Out[29]: True
````

```
In [30]: 0.7 < True
Out[30]: True
```

## Logical operators

The **logical operators** allow operations between booleans. They are `and`, `or` a `not`. They work in the same way as in other languages: (a) `x and y` is true when both `x` and `y` are true, (b) `x or y` is true when at least one of them is true, and (c) `not x` is true when `x` is false. Examples:

```
In [31]: True and False
Out[31]: False
```

```
In [32]: True or False
Out[32]: True
```

```
In [33]: not True
Out[33]: False
```

Since expressions involving comparison operators are evaluated and turned into either `True` or `False`, we can combine them with logical operators. Example:

```
In [34]: 5 < 7 and ' ' <= '6'
Out[34]: True
```

## Homework

1. Calculate the square root of 2 and take the square of it. Do you get 2? Why?

2. Evaluate the expressions `1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 == 4/3` and `1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 == 5/3`. One is true and the other one is false. Is Python crazy?
